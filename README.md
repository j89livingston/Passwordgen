# A Random Password Generator

I created a simple password generator that randomly produces 8-16 characters. It contains some basic features such as:

1. GUI using TKinter
2. Generate button 
3. Copy button
4. 3 Checkboxes to include/exclude capital letters, numbers, and symbols

## Instructions:
1. Install Tkinter using pip 
> pip install tk
2. Run passwordgenGUI.py in terminal
3. Enjoy!


### Future updates:

These are features I would like to add

1. adding scrollbar to change character amount, with tick placement for each number
2. colored buttons
3. add a background color or image
4. change font style/color to complement other changes
5. Make into a fully funtional bootable app using py2app
